## About

This project focuses on customer segmentation and the development of targeted marketing strategies for a bank using a real-world dataset. Customer segmentation is a crucial process for any business, allowing personalized marketing efforts to enhance customer engagement and retention. In this project, we use data analytics and machine learning techniques to categorize customers into distinct segments and derive effective marketing strategies for each group.

---

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to use customer segmentation techniques to better understand our bank's customers. By grouping customers into different categories based on their characteristics, we want to:

1. **Improve Tailored Marketing:** Create marketing strategies that are just right for each group of customers, so we can better keep them as clients.

2. **Make Better Business Choices:** Make smarter decisions about our bank's products and services, based on what each group of customers likes and needs.

3. **Offer a Better Experience:** Provide services and products that fit the specific needs of each group of customers.

4. **Increase Our Bank's Success:** Find opportunities to suggest other products or services that each group of customers might be interested in.

5. **Build Stronger Customer Relationships:** Make our clients happy by giving them exactly what they need.

---

## Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing stage, we prepare the dataset for clustering and analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing outliers.

---

## Customer Segmentation

We employ the  K-Prototype clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on various attributes such as job type, marital status, education, and more. This helps us understand the diversity among customers and tailor marketing strategies for each group.

---

## Profiling Clusters

For each cluster, we create a profile highlighting the key characteristics of its members. These profiles include information about the dominant job types, marital status, education level, housing and loan status, and age and balance statistics.

---

## Marketing Strategies

We develop marketing strategies based on the insights gained from customer segmentation and profiling. These strategies are aimed at enhancing customer engagement, reducing churn, and increasing overall customer satisfaction. For example, we may suggest offering first-time homebuyer programs to attract potential homeowners in a specific cluster.

---

## Project Status

This project is complete and has successfully achieved the goals of customer segmentation and marketing strategy development. The findings can be applied to real-world business scenarios for targeted marketing efforts.
