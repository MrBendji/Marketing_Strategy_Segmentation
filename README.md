## About

This project focuses on customer segmentation and the development of targeted marketing strategies for a bank using a real-world dataset. Customer segmentation is a crucial process for any business, allowing personalized marketing efforts to enhance customer engagement and retention. In this project, we use data analytics and machine learning techniques to categorize customers into distinct segments and derive effective marketing strategies for each group.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to address the issue of customer churn in the telecom industry, using the dataset obtained from Kaggle. Specifically, our goals are as follows:

1. Develop a predictive model: Build a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are likely to churn in the near future.

2. Improve customer retention: Implement targeted retention strategies based on the model's predictions to reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty.

3. Optimize resources: By accurately identifying customers at risk of churn, we aim to optimize resource allocation and reduce customer acquisition costs.

## Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing stage, we prepare the dataset for clustering and analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing outliers.

---

## Customer Segmentation

We employ the K-Modes clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on various attributes such as job type, marital status, education, and more. This helps us understand the diversity among customers and tailor marketing strategies for each group.

---

## Profiling Clusters

For each cluster, we create a profile highlighting the key characteristics of its members. These profiles include information about the dominant job types, marital status, education level, housing and loan status, and age and balance statistics.

---

## Marketing Strategies

We develop marketing strategies based on the insights gained from customer segmentation and profiling. These strategies are aimed at enhancing customer engagement, reducing churn, and increasing overall customer satisfaction. For example, we may suggest offering first-time homebuyer programs to attract potential homeowners in a specific cluster.

## Project Status

This project is complete and has successfully achieved the goals of customer segmentation and marketing strategy development. The findings can be applied to real-world business scenarios for targeted marketing efforts.
